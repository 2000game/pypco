Thanks for your interest in contributing to pypco!

Contributions are always welcome. Here are a few requirements to keep in mind if you're contributing code:

1. Don't make major changes without creating an issue to talk about it first.
2. Provide unit tests with your code. Code won't be merged until it has coverage; the quickest way to make that happen is for your to provide tests with your code.
3. Don't break backwards compatibility for anyone who is currently using the library.
